       <p2>What equipment do I need in order to play?</p2>
   <p>Per WCHL and USA Hockey Rules (the rule is available from the <a href="http://www.usahockeyrulebook.com/page/show/1084402-rule-304-protective-equipment">USA Hockey website</a>), players must wear:
        <ul>
            <li>All players must wear numbered uniforms in the proper team colors. </li>
            <li>All players must wear the protective equipment required by USA Hockey during games and warm-ups.  This includes: 
                <ul>
                    <li>gloves</li>
                    <li>shin pads </li>
                    <li>shoulder pads</li> 
                    <li>elbow pads</li>
                    <li>hip pads or padded hockey pants</li> 
                    <li>helmet including ear protection</li>
                </ul>  
            <li>Players are not required to wear a full face shield but it is strongly recommended.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p2>How much will equipment cost?</p2>
    <p>It depends on how much you're willing to spend.  You can find used equipment at a variety of stores including Play It Again Sports or even on eBay.<br />  There are stores dedicated to hockey equipment such as <a href="http://www.jerryshockey.com/">Jerry's Hockey Warehouse</a>, <a href="http://www.gunzos.com/">Gunzo's</a> or <a href="http://www.totalhockey.com">Total Hockey.</a></p>

    <p2>What if I really want to play but can't afford all the equipment?</p2>
    <p>Please get in touch with the club President or one of the captains if you're in need of equipment.  We do have a limited amount of equipment that can be loaned out.</p>
    
    <p2>Do I need a Frozen Snappers Jersey?  How do I get one?</p2>
   <p>At the beginning of every season and order is placed for jerseys for any player that needs/wants one.  The cost for both a home and away jersey is roughly $70-90 each.</p>
   
    <p2>How often does the team practice?</p2>
    <p>In the pre-season (August/early September), we try to schedule weekly practices.  Once the season begins, practices are scheduled as ice time is available, typically once a month.  There is an adult class at Hoffman on Sundays run by one of our player/coaches.</p>
    
    <p2>How long is the season?</p2>
    <p>The WCHL (Women's Central Hockey League) season runs from October into March with playoffs taking place in mid-late March/early April.</p>
 
    <p2>Are there team fees? How much are they?</p2>
    <p>Team fees vary per season. We do offer an option that allows players to pay a discounted fee if they make their full payment within the first month of the season. Monthly payments are also an option. Prior to playing all players and coaches need to register with USA Hockey, each and every season. USA Hockey registration is roughly $45/year. Go to <a href="http://www.usahockey.com">USA Hockey</a> and click on "Become a USA Hockey Member" to register.</p>
    
    <p2>Where are games played?</p2>
   <p>Home games are played at Triphahn Center Ice Arena at the Hoffman Estates Park District, 1685 W. Higgins Road, right off the Barrington Rd. exit of I-90. For away games, we play at a variety of ice rinks in the greater Chicagoland area.  Occasionally, out of state games are played but not on a regular basis.</p>
    
    <p2>Sounds like a LOT of driving.  Does anyone carpool?</p2>
   <p> For some of our farther out games, some players will meet at the rink and carpool from there.  We also have players that come from different suburbs or downtown Chicago who carpool.  Just ask!</p>
