    <p>Practices and home games are played at Triphahn Ice Arena in Hoffman Estates. Away games are played throughout the Chicagoland and on occasion, out of town.  Division teams are located in Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, St. Louis, and Iowa. <br><br>
    
   Each team plays approximately 12-14 league games.  A player qualifies to play in the playoffs tournament, should their team qualify, if the player has been in half of the scheduled league games for the season.<br><br>
       
   There are also opportunities to play in other tournaments.  Every year the Snappers send at least one team to the Pond Hockey in Eagle River, WI.  The Pond Hockey Tournament is typically in mid-February and always proves to be a blast!  Please note, there is an additional fee (not including hotel and transportation costs) to participate in Pond Hockey.</p>
