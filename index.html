        Snapping it on since 1997</div>
    <div id="main">
        The Frozen Snappers got a humble start in the late 1990's. <a href="http://www.usahockey.com/news_article/show/848565?referrer_id=836196">(See the USA Hockey article on the Snappers!)</a> A few groundbreaking women decided it was time for them to PLAY hockey instead of just watch and cheer. In the early years, there weren't many women's teams. But, as recognition of women's hockey grew, so did the number of teams. Eventually, the Women's Central Hockey League <a href="https://www.wchlonline.com">(WCHL)</a> came into being and the Frozen Snappers joined the league.<br><br> Fast forward to 2010, the Snappers moved to the Triphahn Ice Arena in the Hoffman Estates Park District and have called Triphahn ever since. Beginning as a just one team, the Snappers have grown to two full teams. The Snappers currently have a Division 6 (Beginner/Novice) team and a Division 2 (Advanced) team.<br><br> Whether you are just beginning in hockey or have been playing your whole life, we'd love to have you join us!<br> <br> <br> <br>
